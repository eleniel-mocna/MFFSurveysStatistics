# MFF Survey statistics

In this repository I share results of my statistical study into survey of 
the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles university.

I reject the hypothesis that subjects get ranked worse during the online (virtual)
teaching compared to the in-person teaching and suggest more research into
this matter.

For more info see the `surveys.ipynb` file.

This repository was created for the statistics and probability class
of above-mentioned faculty in september 2022.
